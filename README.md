In today's business environment, companies need to deliver the best customer experience and deliver it consistently. With the intense competition, customers have choices and will jump ship at a moment's notice. Companies know the importance of automation and have started their journeys toward autonomous networks to provide a consistent customer experience that has their customers raving about their products and service. However, how is that achieved?

- Driving digital transformation by automating can:
- Eliminate technical debt and increase efficiency
- Reduce human error, which is responsible for 75% of network outages
- Improve customer and employee experiences
- Create consistency at scale
- Ensure high levels of compliance

While all those benefits are essential to all companies, most companies start their automation journey with the last step, which is automating the configuration of their devices. Testing and assurance come down the line when time is free, but usually when disaster strikes and networks are down. In that event, there is no documentation, topologies, or insight into the network to troubleshoot or avoid the problem to begin with.  

We will focus on a BGP project where public peering at an Internet Exchange (IX) is automated. It is common to have hundreds of companies in IXs that would benefit from peering with. This peering will provide more routes to pertinent services for your customers. 
The task can be very time-consuming but is necessary to provide your customers internet access that is effecient with redundancy.

As I mentioned before, automation is usually the first task focused on, so today, we will focus on a tool that will transform your network and how you operate. 

IP Fabric network infrastructure management platform helps companies with:
- Network Discovery
- Advanced analytics
- Detailed vision 
- API integration 

You can operate technologies instead of vendors when you implement IP Fabric in your network. The tools available through IP Fabric are endless, but we will focus on what it does for BGP peering in the IX.

With IP Fabric, you now have the opportunity to get an overview of your entire network. You can verify before and after complex or bulk changes. If you are driving digital transformation in your company, IP Fabric is that first step necessary before any automation takes place. If you have already started automation, no problem, IP Fabric still has your back. 

While automating, you can configure bulk amounts of devices. IP Fabric allows you to check the device's health before and after the change. Also, you get a deep analysis of your protocols, so you can check certain aspects of BGP that are not obvious from a CLI check. Also, who wants to manually document, access each device to check BGP session with several commands, and verify bulk changes through the CLI? That kind of defeats the whole purpose of automation. It also helps you understand the importance of IP Fabric's network discovery and assurance. 

Some issues that can linger from BGP are:
- Discovery issues
- What gets bounced and what gets received
- Losing routes
- Managing neighbor details
- Prefix received 
- Misconfigurations

Those are a few issues that can cause critical problems in a network. With IP Fabric, you can easily navigate your network using advanced filters, interactive network diagrams, and full-picture analytics. 

The best part of all, IP Fabric is simple to install in your network, licensing is easy to understand, and you have on-prem control of the platform.
